The way this works from the user's perspective is that they run the program and then the graph is printed for them with the X-axis running down the compiler. Internally, this program uses a for loop that iterates x values from 0-21.0 in increments of 0.1, and inside of that for-loop, there is a formula that calculates the y value of the function at each specific point of x. Then, it iterates from 0 to the y value but the y value is scaled so that it can print out enough '#' and so that the graph is somewhat visually accurate. I verified that the output is correct because I used the same sample eqation so that I can compare mine to the sample solution.
