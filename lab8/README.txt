So.. I had everything working correctly with the interactive mode until I tried to add the skipped list and going back to it.. If you could please read my code I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working but functionally it seemed like it should work to me.
It's too late to ask for help for me so I just thought I might just keep the skipped list and returning back to it. I was trying to debug it but it made me too mad. Thanks!

I did both of the extra credits, I didn't use a specific set of words so it might actually work I have no clue.
