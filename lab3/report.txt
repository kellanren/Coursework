From the user's perspective, they see a display of the menu of options that they have. Then, they can choose their option of what they want to do(add,  subtract, multiply, divide, or quit), with an integer that corresponds to each option. Then, they enter an integer from 1-5 for what operation they want to do. After that, they are prompted to enter two doubles and then the operation is carried out and displayed for them. They are always able to quit by entering 5 in the menu. 
Internally, there are functions created for each operation and then one for displaying the menu. At the start, it displays the menu so that the user can pick, and then uses the scanf function to store their choice as an int. Then, there is a while loop. inside this loop, it checks first if the value they entered is 5. If it is, it displays a goodbye message and then quits the loop. If not, it then sees if their number is between 1 and 5. If not, it goes back to the top and displays the menu. If it is, it uses a switch with their value as the parameter and then iterates through each case from 1 to 4. Then, the seleected case uses the function for the operation that the selected number corresponds to, using their inputs for the two numbers to complete the operation. Then, it runs through the while loop again until the user enters 5. 
To verify the program is correct, I tested the outside cases of numbers not between 1 and 5, which works correctly, and then tested all cases of positive and negative numbers, which works as well.
